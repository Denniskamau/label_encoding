# label_encoding

Label encoding refers to the process of transforming the word labels into numerical form.

This enables the algorithms to operate on our data.

In the real world, labels are in the form of words, because words are human readable.

We label our training data with words so that the mapping can be tracked. 

To convert word labels into numbers, we need to use a label encoder
